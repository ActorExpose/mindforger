Are you drowning in information, but starving for **knowledge**? Where do you keep your **private remarks** 
like ideas, personal plans, gift tips, how-tos, dreams, business vision, finance strategy, auto 
coaching notes? Loads of documents, sketches and remarks spread around the file system, cloud, 
web and Post-it notes? Are you affraid of your knowledge **privacy**? Are you able to **find** then once you create them? 
Do you know how are they mutually **related** when you read or write them? No?
